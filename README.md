# Regular Expression State Transition Program

## Overview
This Java application is designed to create a state transition system based on a given regular expression. The program parses the regular expression and constructs a series of states and transitions, which are then represented in a tabular format. It demonstrates concepts such as string manipulation, regular expressions, and data structures in Java.

## Features
- **Regular Expression Parsing**: Takes a regular expression and parses it into discrete components.
- **State Transition Creation**: Constructs a series of states and transitions based on the regular expression.
- **Table Representation**: Outputs the states and transitions in a table format for easy visualization.
- **Color-coded Output**: Utilizes color coding in the console output for enhanced readability.

## Running the Program
To run the Regular Expression State Transition Program, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Java Program**:
   - Ensure Java is installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `Main.java`.
   - Compile the program using the command `javac Main.java`.

2. **Execute the Program**:
   - Run the program with `java Main`.
   - The output will display the parsed regular expression, the created states and transitions, and a table representing the state transition system.

## Example Usage
- If the regular expression is `abc|d|t|rfg|hi`, the program will output a series of states and transitions that represent this expression. It will also display a table where each state and its corresponding transitions are shown.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance and improve this program are welcome. Potential improvements include optimizing the parsing algorithm, supporting more complex regular expressions, or enhancing the visual output of the transition table.
